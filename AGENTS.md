## Repository Context

This is a Chrome Manifest V3 extension that provides global keyboard shortcuts
for controlling YouTube Music. It is optimized for the Chrome web browser on
macOS.

Chrome global commands are the ONLY supported mechanism. No native helpers, no
OS-level hooks.

## Hard Constraints (DO NOT VIOLATE)

- Do NOT introduce native messaging or helper apps
- Do NOT add support for other music services
- Do NOT add analytics, telemetry, or remote calls
- Do NOT refactor files unrelated to the task

## Target Platform

- macOS
- Google Chrome
- Manifest V3

## Coding Style

- Prefer clarity over abstraction
- Keep injected scripts small and deterministic
- Retry loops must be time-bounded
- Use aria-label selectors where possible
- Avoid deep DOM traversal (>2 levels)

## TypeScript & Build Constraints

- All extension source lives in `src/` (manifest, HTML, CSS, TypeScript)
- The build produces a complete, loadable extension in `dist/`
- Use esbuild for bundling; avoid adding additional build tools unless asked
- Do not commit `dist/` output

## Editing Rules

- Modify only the files explicitly requested
- Preserve existing behavior unless told otherwise
- Do not rename commands, files, or constants without approval

## Editing Discipline

- Do not restructure build config, tsconfig, or manifest unless requested
- When implementing a feature, change the minimum number of files possible
- Prefer adding new code over refactoring working code

## Debugging Expectations

- Surface failures via return values or stored status
- Avoid silent failures
- Log useful messages in the service worker when debug is enabled

## Testing Philosophy

- Prefer TDD for pure logic (tab selection, command routing, utilities)
- Do NOT attempt full TDD for Chrome APIs or injected DOM behavior
- Integration behavior is primarily validated manually via hotkeys
- Tests should be lightweight and optional, not infrastructure-heavy
- Avoid adding test frameworks or E2E harnesses unless explicitly requested

## Version Control Expectations

- Changes should be structured so they can be committed incrementally
- Avoid mixing refactors with new behavior in the same change set
- Prefer small, focused commits that represent a single working step
- Commit messages should be concise and imperative (e.g. "feat: add play/pause
  command")
- Do not suggest squashing commits unless explicitly asked
- Assume `jj` is used for version control, backed by git
- Favor commit granularity suitable for `jj split` if needed
